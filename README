Each of the included scripts adds a simple utility for use in everyday 
terminal usage. The individual uses for the scripts are in the wiki at 
http://github.com/SashaCrofter/Bash-Utilities/wiki, and in the comments 
at the top of the scripts themselves.

To use these scripts, place them (or any subset of them) in a folder 
included in your system's $PATH directory. When they are in place, do $ 
chmod +x [script] or $ chmod +x [script0] [script1] to make them usable. 
To invoke one, simply do $ [script].

Attribution Liscense, meaning that you can use and modify these scripts 
as you like so long as attribution is given to the original source.
